# What services do you offer

The main service we provide is SLaS, or Self-Loathing-as-a-Service. It comes with additional perks such as periodical reminders of how little you have achieved in life and push notifications whenever your best friends share something amazing online that makes you feel small.

# What are the available plans?

The available plans are:

- **Free ($0 per month):** you can have access to basic SLaS functionality, such as periodical reminders of your insufficiency.
- **Premium ($10 per month):** you can have access to advanced functionality, such as notifications of your friends' achievements. Plus, API calls are free.
- **Enterprise ($100 per month):** you can have access to all the functionalities in the premium plan plus prioritized customer support, so you can always have someone to talk you down of your cloud whenever you're feeling too good about yourself.

# Can I use credits to buy a more advanced plan?

No, credits cannot be used to buy an advanced plan.
They can be used to access:

- Access the API, so you can self-loath on your own services.
- Unlock cosmetic features, such as colorful reminders of your failures.
- Inflate one or more balloons, which can infuse your meaningless existence with some air.

# How much does the API cost?

The API costs $1 per call in the free plan, and $0 per call on the premium and enterprise.

# What countries do you support?

We support all English-speaking countries. Countries where the main language is not English are not supported.

# Do you offer discounts?

We offer huge discounts for PhD students, because they are already so deep into self-loathing that they can use our service for almost zero cost. As such, we provide up to 90% discount if your dissertation has been rejected more than 3 times by the academic committee.
